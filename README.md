# Kaodim-test
this repository is built to solve an interview question from Kaodim

Architecture Question (1/2):

 This ask is to build the entire infrastructure from covering various aspects of a general IT setup. I see two aspects in the question to be considered while we are designing the setup.
  1. A secure and common platform accessible for the entire team.
  2. A decoupled platform segregated by teams specific to their own domains.
  
Solution:

I will try to keep this concise and precise. We can talk on the soution during the technical discussion I believe.

We can maintain a master account that controls and manages it's child accounts via needed cross account policies.
